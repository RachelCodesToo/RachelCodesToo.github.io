I’ve watched some of the video links more than once and I must say that the most challenging part thus far is not having the same computer system as any of the instructors on learn.co. I’ve had to delete, create and re-clone from git more times than I can remember but in doing so, I can say that I know how to start a gem like the back of my hands. During the process of creating the project I had to follow instructions to install Virtual Box and Lubuntu into my computer. I’ve watched countless videos and have reached out to friends and co-hort mates to figure out how to navigate a completely foreign system in a span of two weeks. I can now say I am more comfortable in using a command line interface. I am able to see the directories, create new folders from command line, rename files and transfer files. Another huge lesson in this process is learning to reach out for help which I find very difficult. That I would have to say has been the most challenging feat because I am not the type of person who is good at asking for help. I am meek, shy or maybe full of ego which made asking for help extremely difficult. One of the things that stuck out with me as well is that our learning Coach Valerie has said that isolation can be brutal and no words spoken could be more true. Collaboration helps you see the errors and help you navigate the program more easily. Time management has been my weak spot and now puts me in a position where I’m starting to plan out my days better and allow for real time for work to get done. 

Now onto more technical things. I find it fascinating how any assignment of words in the right syntax can be read by Ruby and how changing the syntax in a more readable form will help any other programmers that you might be collaborating with fully understand what your program is attempting to do. The objects made and how user prompt interacts based on the flow of the program is a beautiful thing to see once it is working properly. After all the hurdles that I went through I am still very happy to say that I am looking forward to my next creation.
