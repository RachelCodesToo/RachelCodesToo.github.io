This has been an interesting journey thus far. From not knowing a lick of coding to semi- understanding key concepts. I knew that going into this that failure wasn't an option and that in order to be successful that I would really have to apply myself and think outside of the box. A lot of the times I got stuck by thinking that the simplest thing needs some complex solution and that my brain goes on overdrive when all that coding is asking me for is to translate basic logic and turn it into basic words the program will read. I think the same goes for my tendencies in real life. There could be a not so complex task and I make it so by overthinking things and not going with the flow. This attribute of myself is one that I would really like to work on.

Speaking of attributes... I think one of the most beautiful things I've come to appreciate going back to school 10 years after I finished is our collaborative beautiful minds. I have so much appreciation for the staff of Flatiron and their relentless belief that we can all make it somehow( kind of a semi-bleak statement). Their approach to teaching (Socratic Method) forces us to come out of our shell( aka figure it out yourself with guidance). Another thing that I wish for is to have everyone who's on our co-hort be on the call every time we have it. I just enjoy the experience of hearing everyone's approach but I think not everyone is so keen on sharing but it's my favorite part. Like the way Kal questions logic, how Chuck approaches a problem and how Jesse seems to just get it. I'm such a fan of each one of their brains they'd probably be creep'd out if I said it to them face to face. Our Co-Hort Lead Ally is another brain to admire. She comes up with ways to explain the code someone else came up with and designs a different way for another student to comprehend why it worked out the way it did. 

I'm thankful for all these experiences as I work on my own brain and let it think outside of the box to solve and be a better open-minded programmer.
